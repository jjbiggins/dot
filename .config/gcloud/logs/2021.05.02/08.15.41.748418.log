[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    [1mgcloud compute ssh[m is a thin wrapper around the [1mssh(1)[m command that takes
    care of authentication and the translation of the instance name into an IP
    address.

    Note, this command does not work when connecting to Windows VMs. To connect
    to a Windows instance using a command-line method, refer to this guide:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#windows_cli

    The default network comes preconfigured to allow ssh access to all VMs. If
    the default network was edited, or if not using the default network, you
    may need to explicitly enable ssh access by adding a firewall-rule:

        $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create --network=NETWORK \
            default-allow-ssh --allow=tcp:22

    gcloud compute ssh ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the
    project's metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is
    generated using [1mssh-keygen(1)[m (if the [1m--quiet[m flag is given, the generated
    key will have an empty passphrase).

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    To SSH into 'example-instance' in zone [1m[1;4mus-central1-a[1m[m, run:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone=us-central1-a

    You can also run a command on the virtual machine. For example, to get a
    snapshot of the guest's process tree, run:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone=us-central1-a \
            --command="ps -ejH"

    If you are using the Google Container-Optimized virtual machine image, you
    can SSH into one of your containers with:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone=us-central1-a \
            --container=CONTAINER

    You can limit the allowed time to ssh. For example, to allow a key to be
    used through 2019:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone=us-central1-a \
            --ssh-key-expiration="2020-01-01T00:00:00:00Z"

    Or alternatively, allow access for the next two minutes:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone=us-central1-a \
            --ssh-key-expire-after=2m

[m[1mPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS[m
     [[4mUSER[m@][4mINSTANCE[m
        Specifies the instance to SSH into.

        [1m[1;4mUSER[1m[m specifies the username with which to SSH. If omitted, the user
        login name is used. If using OS Login, USER will be replaced by the OS
        Login user.

        [1m[1;4mINSTANCE[1m[m specifies the name of the virtual machine instance to SSH
        into.

     [-- [4mSSH_ARGS[m ...]
        Flags and positionals passed to the underlying ssh implementation.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and SSH_ARGS on the right. Example:

            $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone=us-central1-a -- -vvv \
            -L 80:%INSTANCE%:80

[m[1mFLAGS[m
     [1m--command[m=[4mCOMMAND[m
        A command to run on the virtual machine.

        Runs the command on the target instance and then exits.

     [1m--container[m=[4mCONTAINER[m
        The name or ID of a container inside of the virtual machine instance to
        connect to. This only applies to virtual machines that are using a
        Google Container-Optimized virtual machine image. For more information,
        see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers.

     [1m--dry-run[m
        Print the equivalent scp/ssh command that would be run to stdout,
        instead of executing it.

     [1m--force-key-file-overwrite[m
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     [1m--plain[m
        Suppress the automatic addition of [1mssh(1)[m/[1mscp(1)[m flags. This flag is
        useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or use
        specific ssh/scp features.

     [1m--ssh-flag[m=[4mSSH_FLAG[m
        Additional flags to be passed to [1mssh(1)[m. It is recommended that flags
        be passed using an assignment operator and quotes. Example:

            $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone=us-central1-a \
                --ssh-flag="-vvv" --ssh-flag="-L 80:localhost:80"

        This flag will replace occurences of [1m[1;4m%USER%[1m[m, [1m[1;4m%INSTANCE%[1m[m, and [1m[1;4m%INTERNAL%[1m[m
        with their dereferenced values. For example, passing [1m[1;4m80:%INSTANCE%:80[1m[m
        into the flag is equivalent to passing [1m[1;4m80:162.222.181.197:80[1m[m to [1mssh(1)[m
        if the external IP address of 'example-instance' is 162.222.181.197.

        If connecting to the instance's external IP, then [1m[1;4m%INSTANCE%[1m[m is
        replaced with that, otherwise it is replaced with the internal IP.
        [1m[1;4m%INTERNAL%[1m[m is always replaced with the internal interface of the
        instance.

     [1m--ssh-key-file[m=[4mSSH_KEY_FILE[m
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        [1m[1;4m~/.ssh/google_compute_engine[1m[m.

     [1m--strict-host-key-checking[m=[4mSTRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING[m
        Override the default behavior of StrictHostKeyChecking for the
        connection. By default, StrictHostKeyChecking is set to 'no' the first
        time you connect to an instance, and will be set to 'yes' for all
        subsequent connections. [4mSTRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING[m must be one of: [1myes[m,
        [1mno[m, [1mask[m.

     [1m--zone[m=[4mZONE[m
        Zone of the instance to connect to. If not specified and the
        [1m[1;4mcompute/zone[1m[m property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone
        (interactive mode only).

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        [1m[1;4mcompute/zone[1m[m property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        [1m[1;4mCLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE[1m[m.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       [1m--internal-ip[m
          Connect to instances using their internal IP addresses rather than
          their external IP addresses. Use this to connect from one instance to
          another on the same VPC network, over a VPN connection, or between
          two peered VPC networks.

          For this connection to work, you must configure your networks and
          firewall to allow SSH connections to the internal IP address of the
          instance to which you want to connect.

          To learn how to use this flag, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-advanced#sshbetweeninstances.

       [1m--tunnel-through-iap[m
          Tunnel the ssh connection through Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy for TCP
          forwarding.

          To learn more, see the IAP for TCP forwarding documentation
          (https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/tcp-forwarding-overview).

     At most one of these may be specified:

       [1m--ssh-key-expiration[m=[4mSSH_KEY_EXPIRATION[m
          The time when the ssh key will be valid until, such as
          "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z." This is only valid if the instance is not
          using OS Login. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
          formats.

       [1m--ssh-key-expire-after[m=[4mSSH_KEY_EXPIRE_AFTER[m
          The maximum length of time an SSH key is valid for once created and
          installed, e.g. 2m for 2 minutes. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.
